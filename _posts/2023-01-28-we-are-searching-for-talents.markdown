Welcome to the world of independent game development! My name is Aleksei and I am a beginner game developer who is passionate about creating unique and engaging gaming experiences.

I am currently in the process of building a team of talented individuals to help bring my vision to life. Specifically, I am looking for programmers, artists, and other specialists who share my passion for creating great games.

As an expert in people management and a dev-ops engineer, I am well-suited to handle the infrastructure and management of the studio. I believe that a strong team is the key to success in the competitive world of game development, and I am excited to work with a diverse group of individuals to create something truly special.

If you are a talented programmer, artist, or other specialist who is interested in joining a dynamic and innovative indie game studio, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. Together, we can create something truly amazing!

Thank you for your time and consideration,
Aleksei
